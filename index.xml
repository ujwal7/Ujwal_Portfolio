      <description>As international or domestic students, many students arrive from various locations and countries, making it difficult for them to estimate the rent they must pay. Moreover, each student has unique requirements and options. As a result, their calculations for budgeting and spending could be challenging. Since housing is one of the most important basic requirements, we decided to do an analysis that will be useful for the current students as well as future cohorts in determining the proper rent price that is most suitable for them in order to attend the university.</description>

      <description>Optimal timing for airline ticket purchasing from the consumerâ€™s perspective is challenging principally because buyers have insufficient information for reasoning about future price movements. In this project we majorly targeted to uncover underlying trends of flight prices in India using historical data and also to suggest the approximate price of a flight ticket.
The project implements the validations or contradictions towards myths regarding the airline industry, a comparison study among various models in predicting the optimal time to buy the flight ticket and the amount that can be saved if done so.</description>

      <description>Project Overview: The dataset consists the list of every shooting incident that occurred in NYC going back to 2006 through the end of 2019. Each record represents a shooting incident in NYC and includes information about the event, the location and time of occurrence. In addition, information related to suspect and victim demographics is also included. This data is manually extracted every quarter and reviewed by the Office of Management Analysis and Planning before being posted on the NYPD website.</description>

      <description>In this project, I visualized the COVID-19 dataset published by the Indian government to analyze which states are the most affected and how the testing process is progressing in Indian states. This project assisted me in developing my knowledge of Python data visualization libraries. Below is one of the graph which I&amp;rsquo;ve created in the notebook:   To know more about Data Cleaning and Data Visualization click on the below link</description>

      <description>In this project, I attempted to focus on each supervised learning algorithm separately. I&amp;rsquo;ve used a variety of models and datasets, ranging from Logistic Regression to Random Forest. This project helped me improve my ability to handle data, visualize data, and draw conclusions from it.
Below is one visualization graph on Lending Club data set, in this instance I have used Decision Trees and Randome Forest for prediction.   To know more about each and every model used.</description>

      <description>My interests lie in artificial intelligence and data science. I worked in a variety of fields before deciding to embark on a career in data science. I have nearly four years of work experience in Data Science, Machine Learning, Automation, and Analytics. Furthermore, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked in teams as well as individually to complete end-to-end workflows and projects, which improved my collaborative skills and increased my self-confidence. However, in my early professional years, I was unsure of how to make a proper transition to data science.</description>
